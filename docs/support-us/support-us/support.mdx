## Introduction
Invntio is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible thanks to the support by the community. This tool is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working after hours, and busy weekends.

## How can you help?
Invntio doesn't have a large company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the development. I fully rely on the goodness ❤️ of the people. However, I would love to make this framework even more powerful, to be fully focused on delivering you great solutions that make coding process enjoyable: In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:

* become a backer or sponsor on [OpenCollective](link-to-opencollective)
* use [PayPal](link-to-paypal) to send a one-time donation
* or reach me directly: victorvelazquezcid@gmail.com.
If you fell in love with Nest, or you run a business which is using Nest, consider sponsoring its development to ensure that the project which your product relies on is actively maintained and improved. Also, your support could help me to work more on content that benefits whole Nest community, writing either educational blog posts or recording videos.
